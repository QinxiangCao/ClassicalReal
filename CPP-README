Organization:

Dedekind: our definition of Dedekind real (section 4.1)
Cauchy: our definition of Cantor real (section 4.2)
Uncomputable: our proofs of potential conflicts caused by strong computability axioms (computable trichonomy and computable ceiling function) (section 3)
              our proofs of potential conflicts caused by using computable reals (section 4.3)
correctness: putting our definitions together with our interface.
